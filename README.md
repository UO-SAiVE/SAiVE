## Contributing

Although this package is primarily intended to be a way for the SAiVE research group to distribute their R functions, your contributions would be most welcome. Do do this, please branch the main (or any development branch if you're after specific pieces) and make a merge request to get your changes/additions into the main branch. As this is a public package and repository, please *do not* add any code that you don't intend to make public yet.
