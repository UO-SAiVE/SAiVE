Description: Holds functions useful for SAiVE group research,
    collaboration, and publication in an R package format. This
    facilitates the re-use and re-purposing of code, fosters good code
    writing practices, and can allow others to benefit from the
    work done by the SAiVE group. Contributions are welcome via the GitHub repository by research group members and non-members.
